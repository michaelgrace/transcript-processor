# SaaS Hosting Checklist: Multi-Tier, Multi-Tech Stack

---

## 1. **Networking**
- [ ] Use Docker networks for internal service communication.
- [ ] Use a reverse proxy (Nginx, Traefik, Caddy) for routing, SSL, and domain management.
- [ ] Isolate sensitive services (DB, internal APIs) from public networks.

## 2. **Security**
- [ ] Use HTTPS everywhere (SSL termination at proxy).
- [ ] Use JWT/OAuth2 for API authentication.
- [ ] Secure cookies (SameSite, HttpOnly, Secure).
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets (never hardcode).
- [ ] Regularly rotate API keys and secrets.
- [ ] Enable CORS only as needed.
- [ ] Limit container privileges (no root, minimal capabilities).
- [ ] Keep all dependencies up to date (use tools like Dependabot).

## 3. **Error Handling & Logging**
- [ ] Centralized logging (ELK stack, Loki, or cloud logging).
- [ ] Structured logs (JSON or similar).
- [ ] Error monitoring (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.).
- [ ] Graceful error responses (never expose stack traces to users).
- [ ] Health check endpoints for all services.

## 4. **Backups & Disaster Recovery**
- [ ] Automated DB backups (daily, offsite).
- [ ] Volume backups for persistent data.
- [ ] Test restore procedures regularly.
- [ ] Store backup credentials securely.

## 5. **Scalability & Performance**
- [ ] Use Gunicorn/Uvicorn with multiple workers for Python APIs.
- [ ] Use Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration.
- [ ] Horizontal scaling for stateless services.
- [ ] Use CDN for static assets (Next.js, images).
- [ ] Enable caching (Redis, CDN, HTTP cache headers).

## 6. **User Management & Access Control**
- [ ] Centralized authentication (OAuth2, SSO, or custom JWT).
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin/user separation.
- [ ] Secure password storage (bcrypt, Argon2).
- [ ] Account lockout and brute-force protection.

## 7. **Payments & Paywall**
- [ ] Use PCI-compliant payment providers (Stripe, PayPal).
- [ ] Never store raw credit card data.
- [ ] Secure webhooks (validate signatures).
- [ ] Test paywall bypass scenarios.

## 8. **DevOps & Automation**
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines for build, test, deploy.
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scanning (Trivy, Snyk).
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Docker Compose, Terraform, etc.).
- [ ] Automated SSL certificate renewal.

## 9. **Monitoring & Alerts**
- [ ] Uptime monitoring (Pingdom, UptimeRobot).
- [ ] Resource monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana).
- [ ] Alerting for failures, high load, or suspicious activity.

## 10. **Compliance & Privacy**
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliance (user data export/delete).
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service.
- [ ] Data encryption at rest and in transit.

## 11. **Other Considerations**
- [ ] API rate limiting/throttling.
- [ ] DDoS protection (Cloudflare, AWS Shield).
- [ ] Session management (expiration, renewal).
- [ ] Multi-region deployment for high availability.
- [ ] Documentation (internal and public API docs).

## Q&A

**Q: How do I connect Next.js and PHP frontends to the Python API?**  
A: Use HTTP(S) requests to the API endpoints, secured with JWT or OAuth2 tokens.

**Q: How do I keep admin and user portals separate?**  
A: Use RBAC in your API and separate Docker services/networks for admin vs. user-facing apps.

**Q: How do I handle secrets?**  
A: Use Docker secrets, environment variables, or a secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Vault).

**Q: How do I ensure zero downtime deploys?**  
A: Use rolling updates in Docker Compose or Kubernetes, and health checks.

**Q: How do I log user actions for auditing?**  
A: Implement audit logging in your backend and store logs securely.
